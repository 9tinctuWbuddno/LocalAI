# How to Play Super Mario 64 with a Friend on Wii
 
Super Mario 64 is one of the most iconic and influential games of all time, but it was never designed for multiplayer. However, thanks to some talented modders, you can now enjoy this classic platformer with a friend on your Wii console. All you need is a Wii with Homebrew Channel installed, an SD card, and a WAD file of Super Mario 64 Multiplayer.

A WAD file is a package of data that contains a game or an application for the Wii. You can download WAD files from various sources online, but be careful not to download any illegal or malicious files. For this tutorial, we will use the Super Mario 64 Multiplayer 1.3.1 WAD file, which is a mod that allows two players to control Mario and Luigi simultaneously in Super Mario 64. You can find this WAD file at [^1^].
 
Once you have downloaded the WAD file, you need to copy it to your SD card. Create a folder named "wad" on the root of your SD card and place the WAD file inside it. Then, insert the SD card into your Wii and launch the Homebrew Channel. From there, select the WAD Manager app and press A to start it.
 
The WAD Manager app will scan your SD card for any WAD files and display them on the screen. Use the D-pad to select the Super Mario 64 Multiplayer 1.3.1 WAD file and press A to install it. The app will ask you to confirm your choice and warn you about the risks of installing unofficial WAD files. Press A again to proceed and wait for the installation to finish.
 
When the installation is done, you will see a message saying "WAD installed successfully". Press any button to return to the Homebrew Channel and exit it by pressing the Home button on your Wii remote. You will now see a new channel on your Wii menu with the Super Mario 64 logo. Select it and press A to launch the game.
 
You will need two Wii remotes to play Super Mario 64 Multiplayer. The first player will control Mario with the D-pad and buttons, while the second player will control Luigi with the motion sensor and buttons. You can also use a Nunchuk attachment for more precise movement. To start the game, press Start on both remotes and choose a save file.
 
You will then see a cutscene of Mario and Luigi arriving at Princess Peach's castle. After that, you can explore the castle and enter different paintings to access various worlds. You can work together or compete with each other as you collect stars, coins, and power-ups. You can also switch between single-player and multiplayer mode by pressing Z on both remotes.
 
Super Mario 64 Multiplayer is a fun and challenging way to experience Super Mario 64 with a friend. It adds a new dimension of gameplay and cooperation to this timeless masterpiece. If you are a fan of Super Mario 64 and have a Wii with Homebrew Channel installed, you should definitely give this mod a try.
  
Some tips and tricks for playing Super Mario 64 Multiplayer are:
 
- Use the camera buttons (C and L) on the Wii remote to adjust the camera angle and zoom in or out. You can also press R to switch between fixed and free camera mode.
- Press A and B together on the Wii remote to perform a long jump. This is useful for crossing large gaps or reaching high places.
- Press Z and A together on the Wii remote to perform a ground pound. This can break some objects or damage some enemies.
- Press Z and B together on the Wii remote to perform a backflip. This can help you gain some height or dodge some attacks.
- If you get stuck or lost, you can press Start on the Wii remote to pause the game and access the map screen. You can also see how many stars you have collected and exit the current world.

Super Mario 64 Multiplayer is not an official Nintendo product and may contain some bugs or glitches. If you encounter any problems, you can try deleting the WAD file from your SD card and reinstalling it. You can also check the official website of the mod at  for updates, patches, or support.
