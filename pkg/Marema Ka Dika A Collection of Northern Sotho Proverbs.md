Proverbs are short and wise sayings that express a general truth or advice. They are often used to teach moral lessons, to comment on human nature, or to express common sense. Proverbs are part of the oral tradition and culture of many African languages, including Northern Sotho. Marema Ka Dika aims to preserve and promote this rich heritage by providing a comprehensive and accessible source of Northern Sotho proverbs.
 
The book is divided into three sections. The first section contains an introduction that explains the origin, structure, function, and classification of proverbs. The second section contains the proverbs themselves, arranged alphabetically according to their first words. Each proverb is given in Northern Sotho, followed by a literal translation, an explanation, and an equivalent proverb in English or Afrikaans. The third section contains an index of keywords that helps the reader to find proverbs on specific topics.
 
Marema Ka Dika is a valuable resource for students, teachers, researchers, and anyone interested in learning more about the wisdom and beauty of Northern Sotho proverbs. The book can be downloaded as a pdf file from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].
  
Some examples of Northern Sotho proverbs from Marema Ka Dika are:
 
- Mmago ngwana o tshwara thipa ka bogaleng. (The mother of a child holds a knife by its blade.) This means that a mother will do anything to protect her child, even if it hurts her.
- Phukubje ga e tshwane le kgaka. (A hyena is not like a guinea fowl.) This means that different things cannot be compared or treated the same way.
- Tau tÅ¡a hloka seboka di shitwa ke nare e hlotsa. (Lions that lack a leader are defeated by a limping buffalo.) This means that without unity and guidance, even the strong can be defeated by the weak.

The book also contains some proverbs that are unique to Northern Sotho and have no equivalent in other languages. For example:
